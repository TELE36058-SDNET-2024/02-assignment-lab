# Network Automation with Netmiko and Python Assignment

## Objective
Gain hands-on experience in automating network tasks using Netmiko and Python. Understand how to connect to, configure, and retrieve information from network devices.

## Background
Netmiko is a Python library that simplifies the process of connecting to network devices via SSH. It supports a wide range of devices from different vendors.

## Requirements
- Basic understanding of Python programming.
- Basic knowledge of networking concepts and device configurations.
- Access to a network device or a network simulator.
- Use 2 Network devices

## Part 1: Setting Up the Environment
### 1. Install Netmiko
Use pip to install Netmiko (`pip install netmiko`).

### 2. Access to a Network Device
Ensure you have SSH access to a network device or a simulated device.

## Part 2: Connecting to a Device
### 1. Create a Python Script
Write a Python script to connect to the network device using Netmiko.

### 2. Retrieve Device Information
Use the script to execute commands and display the output.

## Part 3: Configuring the Network Device
### 1. Configuration Commands
Extend the script to send configuration commands to the device.

### 2. Verification
Verify the configuration changes by executing appropriate show commands.

## Part 4: Automating Tasks
### 1. Automate a Routine Task
Identify a routine task and write a script to automate this task.

### 2. Logging
Implement logging in your script to log the operations.

## Part 5: Error Handling and Reporting
### 1. Error Handling
Add error handling in the script to manage exceptions.

### 2. Generate a Report
Generate a report that includes the commands executed, the changes made, and any errors encountered.

## Submission
- The Python scripts developed.
- A detailed report documenting the process and the code.

## Grading Criteria
- Correct implementation and use of Netmiko.
- Functionality of the scripts.
- Quality of the report, including the description of the process.
